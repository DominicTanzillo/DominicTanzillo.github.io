      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dominic&amp;rsquo;s work is fundamentally about deploying medical systems in low-resource settings. From building &lt;a href=&#34;https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project/virtual-reality-health-education-advanced-learning-vr-heal-2024-2025/&#34;&gt;virtual reality education platforms&lt;/a&gt; to train without the use of expensive medical equipment, to designing applications that can &lt;a href=&#34;https://skintaglabs.github.io/main/&#34;&gt;screen for cancer from a phone&lt;/a&gt; without an internet connection, his work is about making health more accessible. He thinks of it as making tools that will work in space but focused on real-world applications here on Earth — tying a line between global health and space medicine. He writes about his MEng work on his &lt;a href=&#34;https://dominictanzillo.substack.com/&#34;&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominic is a fourth-year medical student at Duke University, simultaneously completing a Masters of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence from Duke&amp;rsquo;s Pratt School of Engineering. His research on coagulation risks in microgravity earned him the &lt;a href=&#34;https://medschool.duke.edu/stories/medical-mystery-microgravity-can-space-travel-raise-risk-blood-clots&#34;&gt;Donald B. Hackel Fellowship in Cardiovascular Pathology&lt;/a&gt;, and he received the Barr-Spach Scholarship to support his MEng degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He co-taught the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project/virtual-reality-health-education-advanced-learning-vr-heal-2024-2025/&#34;&gt;VR-HEAL&lt;/a&gt; Duke Bass Connections course (2024–2025), developing virtual reality software for training on tunneled catheter procedures and augmenting the way interventional radiology procedures are taught. The team won the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bassconnections.duke.edu/news/bass-connections-teams-share-research-highlights-2025-showcase/&#34;&gt;2025 Fortin Foundation Bass Connections Showcase&lt;/a&gt; for best showcase work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since February 2023, he has led Duke COMIDA (Customized Outreach for Mothers in Need of Dietary Assistance), a Chancellor&amp;rsquo;s Fellowship Grant project dedicated to supporting Hispanic women through their gestational diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help other students discover the field of space medicine, he has worked with Duke University and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bcm.edu/academic-centers/space-medicine/translational-research-institute&#34;&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&amp;rsquo;s Translational Research Institute for Space Health&lt;/a&gt; (TRISH) to produce several courses. He and his co-instructor produced the first undergraduate-taught digital course: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/learn/space-medicine-duke&#34;&gt;Space Medicine&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://learninginnovation.duke.edu/blog/2021/05/learn-space-medicine-from-the-comfort-of-home/&#34;&gt;Duke Learning Innovation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominic is also passionate about medical education. Since August 2024, he has served as a Duke Anatomy Teaching Assistant, introducing first-year medical students to anatomy through leading live dissections, running weekly review sessions, and developing customized education modules for students with learning accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;
