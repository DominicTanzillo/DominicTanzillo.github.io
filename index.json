After interning in the Spacecraft Software Engineering Branch of NASA\u0026rsquo;s Johnson Space Center, he came back to Duke. With Baylor College of Medicine\u0026rsquo;s Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH), he produced a course on Space Medicine. After the initial success of the course, he and his co-instructor produced a Duke Coursera Course with Duke Learning Innovation.\nWhile at Duke, he worked in the Wang Neurobiology Lab (now at MIT\u0026rsquo;s McGovern Institute) working to apply novel to detect and sort neural activity in mouse exploratory behavior. He volunteered as an EMT with Duke University EMS, served as a camp counselor with Camp Kesem at Duke University, and was a Co-Founder and President of DukeSEDS.\nHe is now the Chapter Expansion Manager of SEDS USA, firmly committed to expanding access to and diversity within the aerospace industry and encouraging more students to consider the field of bioastronautics.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://dominictanzillo.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Dominic is working at Tietronix after graduating from Duke University where he double majored in neuroscience and mathematics.","tags":null,"title":"Dominic Tanzillo","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In fall 2021 we publicly released Space Medicine on Coursera. It\u0026rsquo;s a free course designed to give an introduction to the basics of physiology and how the environment of space and other planets complicates health.\nAs featured in Duke School of Medicine: Magnify, CBS News, and the Duke Chronicle my collaborator Nick Saba and I built the world\u0026rsquo;s first undergraduate taught Coursera Course.\nWith a private launch this summer to over 300 students, a full and free course launched in November 2021.\nThe Course The highlights of our 12 week Duke seminar have been converted into a six week class. We start with history and astrobiology before exploring several health systems and their relations to the extreme hazards posed by interplanetary travel.\nNick and I are committed to sharing the growing field of space medicine with as many students as possible and have kept the full certificate granting course free for all students - an unprecedented decision in Duke\u0026rsquo;s Coursera catalog.\nCheck back soon for links to the publicly available version of the course.\nDuke Learning Innovation Without the assistance of the Duke Learning Innovation this course would never have come to fruition. Nick and I owe a tremendous amount of gratitude to Megan Lancaster, Quentin Ruiz-Esparza, Michael Blair, Nick \u0026ldquo;Grogu\u0026rdquo; Janes, and William Williamson.\nComplementary Podcast The next move for Nick and me will be creating a companion podcast.

Home to the NASA\u0026rsquo;s Mission Control, the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, and NASA\u0026rsquo;s astronauts, Houston is also the destination for Space Health Research.\nAlthough not part of the job description, I wanted to build a course on Space Medicine. Duke allows undergraduates to submit a syllabus and teach a House Course on any subject. The only restriction - no prerequisites.\nAs someone who is only medically trained as an EMT I worked a series of fantastic collaborators to make the course possible. If you would like to watch any of the lectures from me or any of my guests, the course material is avaiable on the TRISH Orbit Platform.\nThe Course To first learn about space, we need to study aerospace. In my very first lecture, I use the story of the Icarus to warn against over enthusiasms of wanting to immediately jump to space. Instead, before we learn to blast off, we need to first learn how to fly. And this is the story of space medicine; much like NASA evolving from NACA, space physiology is an offshoot of extreme physiology and research that dates back to the 17th century.\nThe course is structured as 12 weeks of education. The front half of the course is loaded with information regarding the basics of astrobiology, anatomy, and the unique hazards of aerospace and space travel.\nTRISH With Baylor College of Medicine\u0026rsquo;s Translational Research Institute of Space Health and Students for the Exploration and Development of Space, the lecture series is being hosted online. This first semester is very much a test run and all the lectures will be rerecorded in spring of 2021.\nHowever, we want students to be engaged and consider their ability to get involved in the human spaceflight program!\nFollow along with the lecture as it is updated for all the material.\nMy Collaborators This course would not possible without the help from doctors, astronauts, and astrobiology researchers, all over the world!\n ","date":1599177600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1599177600,"objectID":"659ce19c20539562a0e22a7e8f42e8a1","permalink":"https://dominictanzillo.github.io/courses/space-health-101/","publishdate":"2020-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/space-health-101/","section":"courses","summary":"Publicly available course for introduction to medicine.","tags":null,"title":"Space Health 101","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"To view the lectures please create an account on TRISH Orbit.
